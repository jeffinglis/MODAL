# Modulation of Dopamine for Adaptive Learning (MODAL)

The following provides simulation code and generates figures for:
Inglis, J. B., Valentin, V. V., & Ashby, F. G. (2021). Modulation of dopamine for adaptive learning: A neurocomputational model. Computational brain & behavior, 4, 34-52.

The simulation takes a long time time run in order to generate figures resembling those found in the publication. Therefore, the output files from a previous simulation are provided in the folder and can be loaded in this notebook:

all_avg_firing_rpe.npy
all_avg_firing_tonic.npy
all_population_size_rpe.npy
all_population_size_tonic.npy
dopamine_reward.npy
dopamine_tonic.npy

The simulation contains randomness so results will differ slightly on each run
